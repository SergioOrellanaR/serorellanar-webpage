Chilemergencias(2019) is a break trending application on Chile, and the first of its type on the country. This application was challenging because the chilean government at the date of 2019 doesnt have the information (or at least is not public) of the urgency services location on the country, so the information gathering had to be manual, with more than 1700 different buildings with all its data from all across the country. This mobile application was developed with Dart and Flutter using MapBox SDK and Google maps for routes purposes. This application is free and doesnt contains ads, it's actually available on Play store and earlier than later on App Store.",
